 My name is Conor Wellman. I'm an aspiring software engineer studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Colorado College. I've worked as a software engineering at Connamara Technolgies, and as a research assistant in the field of complex analysis, where I discovered a new family of harmonic mappings. I'm looking forward to working at NIST this summer as part of the SURF program to develop software for the atomic clock system! In my free time, I pursue rock climbing at a semi-professional level and play guitar.

    <h1> Projects </h1>
      <button type="button" class="prjct-btn"> AI Chatbot Website </button>
        <p> AI chatbot website developed as part of the LevelUp Program at Colorado College. Uses Django Framework with HuggingFace AI library.</p>
      <button type="button" class="prjct-btn"> 8a.nu User Softness Calculator </button>
        <p> Rock climbing is a sport with no referees, and the difficulty of each route is considered subjective. Uses Selenium Webdriver to establish a database of climbers and their likelihood to suggest a higher or lower grade than the average for each outdoor climb using data from 8a.nu</p>
      <button type="button" class="prjct-btn"> DreamTeam Workout App </button>
        <p>Final project for CP274 Software Deisgn at Colorado College. Written in Java and using a MySQL database, this application allows users to track and share workout information with friends. The app also implements the ChatGPT API for workout reccomendations.</p>
      <button type="button" class="prjct-btn"> Clustering Algorithms </button>
        <p>Final project for CP307 Data Structures and Algorithms. In a group, we impolemented and tested a variety of clustering alogrithms, including DBScan, Spectral Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and K-Means Clustering</p>
      <button type="button" class="prjct-btn"> Wordle Solver </button>
        <p>Final project for CP222 Computer Science 2. In a group, we implemented and tested multiple algorithms for solving the New York Times "Wordle" game.</p>
