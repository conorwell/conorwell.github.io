    <h1>Conor Wellman</h1>
    <p>I'm an aspiring software engineer studying Computer
       Science and Mathematics at Colorado College. I've worked as a software engineering intern
       at Connamara Technologies, and as a research assistant in the field of complex analysis,
       where I discovered a new family of harmonic mappings and minimal surfaces. I'm looking forward to working 
       at NIST this summer as part of the SURF program to develop software for the atomic clock 
       system! In my free time, I pursue rock climbing at a semi-professional level and play guitar.

          <p> Rock climbing is a sport with no referees, and the difficulty of each route is considered subjective. Uses Selenium Webdriver to establish a database of climbers and their likelihood to suggest a higher or lower grade than the average for each outdoor climb using data from 8a.nu</p>

      <h2>Mathematics</h2>
      <p>In the summer of 2023, I worked with Professor Jane McDougall to research Rosette Harmonic Mappings within the field of Complex Analysis. 
      During this reasearch, I was able to discover and print a new family of Generalized Rosette Harmonic Mappings, which I have presented at
        various symposiums in Colorado.

      <h2>Climbing</h2>
      <p>I spend most of my free time focusing on my climbing career. I've been lucky enough to compete in national finals 
        for lead climbing and bouldering, earning an alternate spot on the US Team and a pass down invite to world championships.
      Outdoors, I have climbed routes up to V14 and 5.14, my proudest being "The Multiverse" (V14) and "The Phoenix" (V14). I am the first
      male from Illinois to achieve boulders of this difficulty.</p>
